# Bike-Sharing


## Overview 
A group of individuals had seen the public bike sharing that was avalible in NYC and decided that they loved how it helped them interact with the city, and they saw how it was being used readily throughout the city. This made them think they could impliment a simmiliar system in their home town. 

They set out, and soon found a group of investors that would consider the idea if there was information backing up the business to ensure that it could me implemented smoothly. I have created Basic visualizations that can be used to see what is needed for a bike sharing system to thrive in a city so investors can feel secure in their business venture to come.

## Analysis 

To see how a bike sharing platform might do in a new city you first need to understand who would be the most interested in using bike sharing, and the conditions it thrives under. The first thing I had been curious of was if the bikes in NYC were mainly being used by tourists or people who had lived in the city avoiding the subway on their commute to work. To do this my first thought was to see what times are the most popular; I assume if these times are concentrated on common times individuals go to work.

In the image above you see that there is a concentration at 8am and 5pm. This is only a concentration, and there is still plenty of business outside of that range but there is obvious correlation with people going to work and bike usage. 

I would assume that people who use the bikes regularly to go to work would have a subscription instead of only paying by ride. To validate this I plotted the ending locations of each trip and sorted it by user type. This is shown below.

Inside of the chart you see that most of the usage is done by members, but the assumption I make from this data is people who don't have subscriptions are likely tourists because they are more commonly going to places such as central park, or the coast (Commonly more touristy places). Subscribers the locations are a bit more spread out but it seems that they are concentrated inside of the city where more jobs would be located. This leads me to believe that many subscribers use the bikes for regular transportation.
